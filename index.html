<h4>I wanted to make a digital photo frame that:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Would show both pictures and video with sound</li>
<li>Would have high storage capacity</li>
<li>Would shuffle the pictures/videos so they weren't in order</li>
<li>Would have buttons to pause and go forwards/backwards through the slideshow</li>
<li>Would have the capability of annotating the pictures and video with text</li>
<li>Would have a motion sensor</li>
<li>Would be large in size, i.e. a large monitor</li>
<li>Would all fit in one package to mount on the wall, i.e. storage, the Pi, buttons, the monitor, etc.</li>
<li>Would be able to handle tens of thousands of pictures and video</li>
<li>Would not need soldering</li>
</ul>

<h2><u>Step 1</u></h2>

Find a spot where your digital media frame will eventually go. You'll want a space that is centrally located which gets high traffic and visibility and where you can mount it on a stud or strut (basically into wood, not drywall). And, of course, it will need access to electricity.

<h2><u>Step 2</u></h2>

Since the Pi enclosure doesn't quite fit with our jumper wires and we don't want to solder, we need to make a little room in the enclosure. Use a hacksaw to cut a small section out of the top to allow for our wires to stick out. Fit your Pi into the enclosure and insert your Rasbpian microSD card into the Pi's card slot.

<h2><u>Step 3</u></h2>

Now, you should test your Pi. Connect it to the monitor using the HDMI cable and connect it to power using the microUSB power supply. There is no "on/off" switch on the Pi so it will start as soon as it is connected to power. You'll also want to connect a keyboard and a mouse to the Pi initially for testing and setup. Follow some tutorial (such as <a href="https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/howto-install-raspbian-on-raspberry-pi/">this</a>) to get the Pi up and running. Make sure your filesystem is expanded, you choose the graphical desktop option for boot, and you update the firmware.

<h2><u>Step 4</u></h2>

Next, follow the installation instructions for the <a href="https://github.com/KenT2/pipresents-next">original pipresents-next</a> and test it out on one of their examples just to make sure it works.

<h2><u>Step 5</u></h2>

Download my fork of pipresents-next <a href="https://github.com/najoshi/pipresents-next-digital-photo-frame">here.</a> I've only changed six of the python files (pp_gpio.py, pp_imageplayer.py, pp_medialist.py, pp_mediashow.py, pp_omxdriver.py, pp_videoplayer.py) and I've commented them with the comment string "NIK" around my changes. Of course, I also changed the README.md and the gpio.cfg file. It probably will not work immediately because none of the inputs are connected. So the next thing you need to do is start connecting the gpio inputs.

<h2><u>Step 6</u></h2>

Now you will connect up the half-size breadboard with our buttons for next, previous, and pause, and the sensor on/off switch. You will be using female-to-male jumper wires. First, insert the pushbuttons so that they straddle the central groove and are spaced equally apart. Make sure the button prongs are inserted fully into the breadboard. Insert a jumper wire for each button into the row of the left prong, where the row is perpendicular to the middle groove. Each row is electrically connected, so it doesn't matter which of the 5 sockets (not including the +/- columns) you put it in, as long as it is in the same row on the same side of the groove. Leave the female ends dangling for now, we will connect them later to the Pi.

Next, insert two more jumper wires into the end of each of the "+" and "-" columns. These will supply our ground and power for our buttons and switches. In order to connect the buttons to the ground column, you will need to create little wire connectors. In order to do this, take a new wire and cut three small pieces out of it. For each piece, slice off the rubber coating at the ends (without cutting the copper wire underneath). Then twist the bare wire ends to make them easier to insert.

Insert the wires so they connect the other prong of the buttons to the ground (i.e. "-") column. Finally, insert the switch into the board on one side of the buttons. Connect the middle prong of the switch to power using another wire connector and connect the right prong to another female-to-male wire.
